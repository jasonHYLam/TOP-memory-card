This is a simple game with a pokemon theme to develop my knowledge and experience with React.
Click on unclicked cards to increase the score; clicking on clicked cards will reset the game.

This project uses PokeAPI: https://pokeapi.co/

## What I've Learned
- Using batch functions to update the same state variable multiple times in the same render.
- Using .then to access asynchronous values from an API.
